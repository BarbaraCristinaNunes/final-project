# Privit Botanical Collection - PBC

## Project Structure

### [scr/Constants.php](https://github.com/BarbaraCristinaNunes/final-project/blob/main/pivity_botanical_collection/src/Constants.php)

I created six (6) arrays where I keep information about phylum, class, order, family, genus and scientific name. Information from array called $genus are from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/2519) and [The Plant List](http://www.theplantlist.org/browse/A/Cactaceae/).

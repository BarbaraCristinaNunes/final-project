# final-project

During BeCode training I had to reate a big project in which I would practice everything that I have leanded since I started the course. In this project I diceided to apply my new skills and knowledge to resolve I problem with which I had to deal such as a biologist in searches laboratories.

## Contextualizing the problem

Such as a biologist I worked in laboratories related to ecology and biodiversity studies. During the searches I had to collect samples such as plants, insects, soil and fungi, and to keep these samples in our laboratory, but I had more experience in searches related to ecology vegetal and plants in general.

Usually there are a lot of students working in these laboratories with different projects that can be related to each other or not. They also keep the data collected in tables without any pre-established pattern to write, keep and share them. 

Although there is data from each project with students and, in vegetable samples cases, there are exsiccates in a physical collection, it is not always so simple to access this data because a student who was keeping the datas left the laboratory or lost these information, datas were not registered correctly, the collection is not well organized or there is a large volume of data that become it is impossible check one by one to see if it is what you need now.  Another big problem in this scenery is that they don't have their own virtual library where they could keep these data saved and they don't feel safe to keep these data in a publics libraries because they don't want people outside their laboratories to have access to their datas.

# final-project

During BeCode training I had to reate a big project in which I would practice everything that I have leanded since I started the course. In this project I diceided to apply my new skills and knowledge to resolve I problem with which I had to deal such as a biologist in searches laboratories.

## Contextualizing the problem

Such as a biologist I worked in laboratories related to ecology and biodiversity studies. During the searches I had to collect samples such as plants, insects, soil and fungi, and to keep these samples in our laboratory, but I had more experience in searches related to ecology vegetal and plants in general.

When we came back to laboratory with our samples you should create exsiccates to keep them in a collection (you can read more about this kind of collection [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium) and about exsiccates definition [here](https://www.etymonline.com/word/exsiccate) and proccess [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiccation)).
